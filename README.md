# Wordly

A chrome extention to improve your vocabulary in a easiest possible way. All it takes is just a double click on the word on any page to add it to your words list and not just the word, it's meaning will also be stored in the list, so you can quickly view later.

## Installation

 1. Go to extensions
 2. Check developer mode
 3. Click load unpacked extension
 4. Select project root folder
 5. Rock & Roll

## TODOs

 - Beautification.
 - Show loading popup while getting meaning from API.
 - Refine double click events (avoid text selection).
 - Random word reminder notification.
 - Lazy loading words if list goes more than 10 words.
 - Ability to remove words from the list.
 - If similar word clicked, fetch from existing list instead of making an API call. Also move the word at the top of the list.
